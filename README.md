# Diaverse
This is a project created for my CIS 4375 Information Systems Capstone class. This project was done in a group, however I coded most of the project. The goal was to make a website for a truck delivery company so that people could send in their job application or login and view what jobs that are available. The site is a prototype and does not represnt a full final version that could be put into prodcution. There are still issues with the site but it is functioning.
